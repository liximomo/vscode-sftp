# sftp sync extension for VS Code
Very simple and intuitive and works.

## Features

* supports multi-root workspace
* dual authentication
* sync directory to remote
* sync directory to local
* download file/directory to local
* upload file/directory to remote
* upload to remote on save
* watch project directory for external changes and automatically update remote
* multiple file format support(file, directory, symbolic link)

## Usage
1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux open command palette, run `SFTP: config` command.
2. Run command on editor context menu or explorer context menu.

*Note1* ：A command must run with a target(file or directory). When Running command within command palette it will ask you to select a folder.

*Note2* ：Sync commands will only be available to a directory. Try not to bind shortcuts to those commands because there is no way to figure out the target directory.

### Commands
| Command              | Description                                  |Detailed description|
| -------------------- |----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `SFTP: Config`         | create a new config file at workspace root  | see below for an explained config file |
| `SFTP: Upload`         | upload file/directory                       | copies selected files from the local to the remote directory, overwriting the remote ones. Files that are only present on the remote side won't be affected. Files that are only present on the local side will be created remotely|
| `SFTP: Download`       | download file/directory                     | same as above, but in the opposite direction |
| `SFTP: Sync To Remote` | sync local directory to remote               | only available for directories. Copies common files (that exist on both sides) from local dir to remote, overwriting destination. If syncMode is set to full, files that exist only on the local side will be created remotely, and files that exist only on the remote side will be deleted|
| `SFTP: Sync To Local`  | sync remote directory to local               | same as above, but in the opposite direction|
  

### Glossary
`config root`: The directory where the `.vscode/sftp.json` file is located in.

## config

  /**
   * The final remotePath of a selected file or directory is 
   *  {remotePath in config file} + {local file Path relative to `config root`}.
   * Example:
   *
   * Local directory structure:
   *  |-a
   *    |-.vscode/sftp.json
   *    |-b
   *      |-c.txt
   *

   *      ...
   *      remotePath: '/home/test',
   *      ...
   *    }
   *    
   *  Running command 'sync to remote' at `c.txt` will result in copying /a/b/c.txt => /home/test/b/c.txt
   *  Explanation:
   *    {config file path} => /a/.vscode/sftp.json
   *    {config root} => /a
   *    {local file path} => /a/b/c.txt
   *    {local Path relative to `config root`} => b/c.txt
   *    {configed remotePath} => '/home/test'
   *    {final remotePath} => '/home/test/b/c.txt'

  /**
   *  available values: update | full
   *  update: sync existing files only (it only affects files that exist on both sides)
   *  full: sync existing files + remove files deleted from the source that are still present at 
   *    the destination + create files that exist on the source and are missing at the destination
   *  If you want just to sync existing files and add missing files, use the `upload` command!
   *  Note: this option only affects the `Sync to remote/local` commands, not `Download` or `Upload`
   */ 
  syncMode: 'update',

  /** Detailed example of how sync/upload/download work. Assume we have the following directories:
  *
  * source-dir
  * |-s1.txt (file that exists only at source)
  * |-common.txt
  * dest-dir
  * |-d1.txt (file that exists only at destination)
  * |-common.txt (common file between source-dir and dest-dir)
  * 
  * DOWNLOAD and UPLOAD are copy operations from one side to the other. They only overwrite and create
  *   files on the destination, without deleting anything.
  *
  * If we download source-dir to dest-dir, the dest-dir will be:
  * dest-dir
  * |-s1.txt (copied from source)
  * |-d1.txt
  * |-common.txt (overwritten with the contents of the same file from source-dir)
  *
  * The effect of SYNC operations depends on the value of syncMode. With syncMode: 'update', only common 
  *   files are copied from one side to the other. With syncMode: 'full', the destination will be modified
  *   to have the same set of files as the source (which implies deleting files that only exist on the 
  *   destination and creating files that only exist at source).
  * 
  * If we sync source-dir to dest-dir using syncMode: 'update', dest-dir wil be:
  * dest-dir
  * |-d1.txt
  * |-common.txt (overwritten with the contents of the same file from source-dir)
  * 
  * If we sync source-dir to dest-dir using syncMode: 'full', dest-dir wil be:
  * dest-dir
  * |-s1.txt (created, because it didn't exist on destination)
  * |-common.txt (overwritten with the contents of the same file from source-dir)
  * and d1.txt is deleted because it didn't exist at source

## Known Issues

### Issue
ENFILE: file table overflow ...
### Solution
MacOS has a harsh limit on the number of open files. Run these commands:
```bash
echo kern.maxfiles=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo kern.maxfilesperproc=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=65536
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=65536
ulimit -n 65536
```
